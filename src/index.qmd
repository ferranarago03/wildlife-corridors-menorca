    Habitat fragmentation poses a critical threat to biodiversity in island ecosystems, reducing species viability by isolating populations. This study presents a Multi-objective Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model applied to the Menorca Biosphere Reserve to optimize the configuration of wildlife corridors and habitat rehabilitation. The model targets four species with distinct requirements: *Atelerix algirus*, *Martes martes*, *Eliomys quercinus*, and *Oryctolagus cuniculus*. Unlike traditional formulations that enforce a single connected component, this approach relaxes connectivity constraints to maximize biological utility within a finite budget, prioritizing critical sub-networks. To address computational complexity, a distilled three-phase heuristic approach was developed. The model has been benchmarked using four solvers: CBC, SCIP, CP-SAT, and Gurobi. Experimental results indicate that the commercial solver Gurobi significantly outperforms open-source alternatives, offering the lowest execution time and variance. The proposed framework provides a spatially explicit strategy that balances ecological integrity, predator-prey compatibility, and economic costs.
