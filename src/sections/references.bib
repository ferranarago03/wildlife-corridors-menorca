abstract = {Abstract The fragmentation of wildlife habitats caused by anthropogenic activities has reduced biodiversity and impaired key ecosystem functions. Wildlife corridors play an important role in linking detached habitats. The optimal design of such corridors considering spatial, ecological and economic factors is addressed in this paper. We present a novel graph-theoretic optimisation approach and a mixed-integer linear programming model to determine an optimal wildlife corridor connecting two given habitat patches. The model maximises the total quality of the corridor and satisfies pre-specified corridor width and length requirements under a resource constraint. Compared to the corridor design models presented in the literature, our model is conceptually simpler, and it is computationally convenient. We applied the model to a real dataset for Eldorado National Forest in California, USA, involving 1,363 irregular land parcels. The model can be extended to design multiple corridors that connect two or more existing habitat patches.},

abstract={Protected wildlife corridors can help counteract habitat fragmentation and link isolated reserve ``islands'' into connected reserve systems. The need for wildlife corridors will grow as expanding human populations place increasing pressure on remaining undeveloped land. A two‐objective zero--one programming model is formulated for the problem of selecting land for a system of wildlife corridors that must connect a known set of existing reserves or critical habitat areas. This problem is modeled as a network Steiner tree problem, under the objectives of minimizing corridor land costs and minimizing the amount of unsuitable land within the corridor system. Linear programming is used to find exact solutions with little or no branching and bounding, and the multi‐objective weighting method is used to generate non‐inferior alternatives. Two hypothetical examples demonstrate the model and solution procedure. Results can help inform planning and decision making for protected area land acquisition and habitat restoration.},

The IPBES Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services is the most comprehensive ever completed. It is the first intergovernmental Report of its kind and builds on the landmark Millennium Ecosystem Assessment of 2005, introducing innovative ways of evaluating evidence.

Compiled by 145 expert authors from 50 countries over the past three years, with inputs from another 310 contributing authors, the Report assesses changes over the past five decades, providing a comprehensive picture of the relationship between economic development pathways and their impacts on nature. It also offers a range of possible scenarios for the coming decades.

Based on the systematic review of about 15,000 scientific and government sources, the Report also draws (for the first time ever at this scale) on indigenous and local knowledge, particularly addressing issues relevant to Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities.},

This paper discusses enhancements and extensions contained in version 6.0 of the SCIP Optimization Suite. Besides performance improvements of the MIP and MINLP core achieved by new primal heuristics and a new selection criterion for cutting planes, one focus of this release are decomposition algorithms. Both SCIP and the automatic decomposition solver GCG now include advanced functionality for performing Benders{\textquoteright} decomposition in a generic framework. GCG{\textquoteright}s detection loop for structured matrices and the coordination of pricing routines for Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition has been significantly revised for greater flexibility. Two SCIP extensions have been added to solve the recursive circle packing problem by a problem-specific column generation scheme and to demonstrate the use of the new Benders{\textquoteright} framework for stochastic capacitated facility location. Last, not least, the report presents updates and additions to the other components and extensions of the SCIP Optimization Suite: the LP solver SoPlex, the modeling language Zimpl, the parallelization framework UG, the Steiner tree solver SCIP-Jack, and the mixed-integer semidefinite programming solver SCIP-SDP.",

In this article we formalize the optimal corridor design as a connected subgraph problem, which maximizes the amount of suitable habitat in a fully connected parcel network linking core habitat areas, subject to a constraint on the funds available for land acquisition. To solve this challenging computational problem, we propose a hybrid approach that combines graph algorithms with Mixed Integer Programming-based optimization. We apply this technique to the design of corridors for grizzly bears in the U.S. Northern Rockies, illustrating the underlying computational complexities by varying the granularity of the parcels available for acquisition. The approach that is introduced is general and can be applied to other species or other similar problems, such as those occurring in social networks.}

abstract = {Establishing wildlife corridors to link detached habitat patches is a widely advocated conservation strategy to reduce the adverse impacts of habitat fragmentation. Given the scarcity of conservation resources, designing an efficient corridor system calls for an optimization approach. The optimal configuration of a wildlife corridor system involving multiple habitat patches poses significant challenges, both methodologically and computationally. This study proposes a two-stage procedure for that purpose. In the first stage, we determine a best-quality corridor between each pair of habitat patches using the method described in Wang et al. (2022). In the second stage, we select a subset of those corridors to assemble a least-cost corridor system using a mixed integer linear programming model presented in this paper. We use an illustrative example to demonstrate the workings of the two-stage method, and then apply it to a real dataset for an area in Cumberland County, Nova Scotia, Canada, involving 1039 irregular land parcels. Results show that an efficient corridor system where each habitat patch is connected to some neighboring habitat patches through a specified minimum number of corridors can be identified conveniently in terms of both data processing and computational effort.}

abstract = {Anthropogenic disturbances fragmenting wildlife habitat greatly contribute to extinction risk for many species. In western Canada, four decades of oil and gas exploration have created a network of seismic lines, which are linear disturbances where seismic equipment operates. Seismic lines cause habitat fragmentation and increase predator access to intact forest, leading to declines of some wildlife populations, particularly the threatened woodland caribou, Rangifer tarandus caribou. Restoration of forests within seismic lines is an important activity to reduce habitat fragmentation and recovery caribou. We present an optimization model with the objective of guiding landscape restoration strategies that maximize the area of connected habitat for a caribou population in a fragmented landscape. We use our model to find optimal strategies for seismic line restoration in the Cold Lake Area of Alberta, Canada, a 6726-km2 expanse of boreal forest that represents prime caribou habitat. We formulate mixed integer programming models that depict the landscape as a network of interconnected habitat patches. We develop and compare formulations that emphasize the population's local or long-distance access to habitat. Optimal restoration involves a mix of two strategies: the first establishes short-distance connections between forest patches with large areas of intact habitat and the second establishes corridors between areas with known species locations and large amounts of suitable habitat. Our approach reveals the trade-offs between these strategies and finds the optimal restoration solutions under a limited budget. The approach is generalizable and applicable to other regions and species sensitive to changes in landscape-level habitat connectivity.}
